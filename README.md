# Python Attendance System
>This is a Python attendance logger which records students' names and date, time, and punctuality status ("Hadir" or "Lambat Hadir") based on a predefined cutoff. All of this is recorded in a .csv file for straightforward monitoring. This project demonstrates my proficiency at using Python's date/time modules, CSV operations, and if/else statements in crafting practical, real-world programs.
